# Image Folder

## Files

The .tx textures were generated using txmake.

* `lookout_4k.hdr` came from https://hdrihaven.com/hdri/?c=indoor&h=lookout from the 4k variant but I have only included the 1k variant for space reasons.
* `bottle_4k.png` I made using the reference images as a template.

## Folders

* `.\render\` contains the final rendered images in both OpenEXR and JPEG.
* `.\reference\` contains the reference images taken of the real object.
